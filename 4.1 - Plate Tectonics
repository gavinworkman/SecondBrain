# 4.1 Plate Tectonics
[[Home]]
**Convergent**: Plates push toward each other, this releases magma, and volvcanos form here **Divergent**: plates push away from each other – ridges or volcanoes, sefloor spreading **Transform**: Plates slide past each other, no ridges/volcanes, tend to have shallow, frequent earthquakes

Earth is made of layers:

* Lithosphere \(crust\)
* Asthenosphere \(upper mantle\)
* Mesosphere \(lower mantle\)

Earthquake formation:

* occur at plate boudnaries
* fault lines lock up – build up stress/energy
* energy releases, causing an earthquake

Earthquake -&gt; Tsunamis

* long sea wave
* also caused by underwater landslides
