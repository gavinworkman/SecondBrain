# 4\.1 Plate Tectonics

[[Class Notes]]

**Convergent**: Plates push toward each other, this releases magma, and volcanoes form here **Divergent**: plates push away from each other – ridges or volcanoes, seafloor spreading **Transform**: Plates slide past each other, no ridges/volcanoes, tend to have shallow, frequent earthquakes

Earth is made of layers:

- Lithosphere (crust)
- Asthenosphere (upper mantle)
- Mesosphere (lower mantle)

Earthquake formation:

- occur at plate boundaries
- fault lines lock up – build up stress/energy
- energy releases, causing an earthquake

Earthquake -> Tsunamis

- long sea wave
- also caused by underwater landslides
