# 4\.3 - Soil Composition and Properties

[[APES]]

## **Vocab**

### Soil Fertility: 

ability of soil to support plant growth

## **Properties**

Soil Texture - % Composition of sand, silt, and clay

Porosity - amount of pore space a soil has (Sand > Silt > Clay)

Permeability - how easily water drains through soil

H2O Holding Capacity - How well water is retained

### Soil that is too sandy (too permeable) drains water too quickly for roots + dries out

## **Nutrients**

N, P, K, MG2, Ca+, NA+

Factors that _Increase Nutrients:_

- organic matter

- humus

- Decomposer Activity

Factors that _Decrease Nutrients:_

- Excessive rain

- Excessive farming

- Topsoil erosion

## **Water**

Factors that **_increase_** H2O holding capacity:

- Aerated soil

- C
