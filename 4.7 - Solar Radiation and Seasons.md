# 4\.7 - Solar Radiation and Seasons

[[APES]]

### Albedo

_Reflection_ of light causing more/less heat to be absorbed

- Color Dependent

### Urban Heat Island

Urban areas are hotter than surrounding rural area due to low albedo of blacktop

Polar Regions colder due to less direct sunlight and high Albedo

## Climate

### Climate Change

Warmer Earth -> melting of ice caps -> lower albedo -> higher heat retention -> warming

### Rain Shadow 

A portion of land that is drier because a high elevation areas blocks moisture from reaching the land (2 diff sides of a mountain)
