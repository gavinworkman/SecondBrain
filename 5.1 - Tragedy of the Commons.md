# 5\.1 - Tragedy of the Commons

> **Individuals will use shared/public resources in their own self interest, degrading them.**

## Why?

When no one owns the resource, no one directly suffers the negative consequences of depleting, degrading, or overusing it (ex. Cows grazing a field too much)

People assume others will overuse the resource if they don't

## Problem

Overfishing can lead to fishery collapse, loss of income, and starvation

## Solution

- _Privatize Land_

- _Implement fees and taxes for use (permits, etc.)_

- _Taxes, laws, fines, and criminal charges for pollution of shared air/soil/water_
