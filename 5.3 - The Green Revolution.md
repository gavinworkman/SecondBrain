### Pros

### Cons

### Effects

## Vocab 

:arrow_down: **__All the following increased with the Green Revolution__** :arrow_down: 

**High-Yield Variety Crops:** Hybrid or genetically modified crops that produce a higher yield

**GMOs:** Contains advantageous genes, such as drought resistance, pest resistance, faster growth, and larger fruits

> :star: All GMO crops are genetically identical, so Biodiversity is decreased.

**Synthetic Fertilizer:** Shift from organic --> man made fertilizers (manure -->ammonium, nitrate, phosphate...)

**Irrigation:** Drawing water from the ground or nearby surface waters and using it to water crops

- Can deplete groundwater sources

- overwatering can drown roots and lead to soil salinization

**Pesticides**: Kills pests and animals that may eat the crops

- Can get washed off of crops and lead to negative effects for nearby ecosystems if it runs off into waterways
