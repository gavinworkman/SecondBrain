# 5\.4 - Agricultural Practices and their Impact

[[APES]]

### Monocropping

Growing one single species

- highly efficient

- decreased biodiversity

- Increased soil erosion in offseason

### Tilling

Mixing and breaking up of soil to make planting easier

- Short term good - fast planting

- Long term bad - erosion, loss of organic matter, lots of dust in air

### Slash and Burn

Cutting down vegetation and burning it to clear land for agriculture and return nutrients in plants to soil

- Leads to deforestation, release of greenhouse gas, increases particulate matter in air    --> asthma

### Synthetic Fertilizers

Increased crop yield in the short term, but they don't return other nutrients to the soil to help feed organic matter like worms and bugs, so over time organic matter decreases
