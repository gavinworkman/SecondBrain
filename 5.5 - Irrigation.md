# 5\.5 - Irrigation

[[APES]]

> In order of least --> most efficient

## Furrow Irrigation

- Trench channels dug along crops and filled with water

- Easy and inexpensive

- 66%

## Flood Irrigation

- Flood entire field

- Easier but more disruptive to plants

- Can drown plants

- 80%

## Spray Irrigation

- Ground/surface water pumped into sprinklers

- More efficient, more expensive (energy)

- 80-90%

## Trickle/Drip Irrigation

- Most efficient, most costly

- holes in hose allow water to slowly drip out

- Used at small farms

- 95%

## Issues with Irrigation

### Waterlogging

Saturating the soil, or the maximum amount of water being held.

- Doesn't allow air to get into pores, leads to plant death/stopping of growth

### Soil Salinization

The process of salt building up in soil over time

## Aquifers and Groundwater

### Aquifers

Usable groundwater deposits for humans

### Groundwater

H2O stored in pore space of permeable rock and sediment layers

> Both replenished by **Groundwater Recharge** (rainwater trickling down through soil)
