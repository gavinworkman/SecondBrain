# 5\.6 - Pest Control Methods & Integrated Pest

[[APES]]

## Pesticides

Chemicals that are toxic to pests

- aims to decrease crop loss due to predation

- Can cause pests to become resistance to pesticide

## GMOs

(Genetically Modified Organisms)

Adds advantageous genes to plants like pest resistance, drought protection, and faster growth

- No genetic diversity, all clones

### Biocontrol

Using a natural predator in one way or another to control the pest population

### Crop Rotation

Many pests prefer one specific crop or crop family. Rotating crops can prevent pests from becoming established in any given field

### Intercropping

Push-Pull system

- Push plants emit chemicals that naturally repel pests

- Pull plants attract pests to lay eggs on them rather than the crops (human shield ts)
