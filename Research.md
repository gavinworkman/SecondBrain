[[Compare and Contrast Essay]]

An annotated bibliography entry consists of two components: the Citation and the Annotation. A list of possible sources is only a working bibliography because you do not yet know which sources you will use. (Your final bibliography will include only those sources you cite—actually refer to—in your paper.) A working bibliography will help you see what is available on your topic, note how to locate each source, and contain the information needed to document. Your annotation should be approximately 100-300 words in length (one paragraph).

Your annotation should  include the following information:

1. A brief summary of the source

2. The source’s strengths and weaknesses

3. Its conclusions

4. Why the source is relevant in your field of study

5. Its relationships to other studies in the field (if applicable)

6. An evaluation of the research methodology (if applicable)

7. Information about the author’s background

8. Your personal conclusions about the source
