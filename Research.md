# Research - C&C Essay

[[Compare and Contrast Essay]]

An annotated bibliography entry consists of two components: the Citation and the Annotation. A list of possible sources is only a working bibliography because you do not yet know which sources you will use. (Your final bibliography will include only those sources you cite—actually refer to—in your paper.) A working bibliography will help you see what is available on your topic, note how to locate each source, and contain the information needed to document. Your annotation should be approximately 100-300 words in length (one paragraph).

Your annotation should  include the following information:

1. A brief summary of the source

2. The source’s strengths and weaknesses

3. Its conclusions

4. Why the source is relevant in your field of study

5. Its relationships to other studies in the field (if applicable)

6. An evaluation of the research methodology (if applicable)

7. Information about the author’s background

8. Your personal conclusions about the source

Fuller, C. W., et al. “Comparison of the Incidence, Nature and Cause of Injuries Sustained on Grass and New Generation Artificial Turf by Male and Female Football Players. Part 1: Match Injuries.” _British Journal of Sports Medicine_, vol. 41, no. Supplement 1, Aug. 2007, pp. i20–26, [_https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsm.2007.037267_](https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsm.2007.037267).

This study tracks injury prevalence on both turf and natural grass fields for both men’s and women’s soccer during matches. The data was given by athletic trainers, who documented the injury, how it happened, where it happened, and what surface it occurred on. While it had similar conclusions as many studies and was not very controversial, it cited that there was no major differences. I used this study as it shows that while there are not major differences, there are still differences between the surfaces, as this study also found that there were around 2 more injuries per 1000 exposure hours on turf than on grass for both men and women. 

\---. “Comparison of the Incidence, Nature and Cause of Injuries Sustained on Grass and New Generation Artificial Turf by Male and Female Football Players. Part 2: Training Injuries.” _British Journal of Sports Medicine_, vol. 41, no. Supplement 1, Aug. 2007, pp. i27–32, [_https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsm.2007.037275_](https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsm.2007.037275).

This study is like the previous except that it tracks injuries occurring during training. This was important to know because while playing surface affects injury rate, the type of playing does as well. During training, one may be jogging around cones and working on technique, leading to much fewer injuries. This is relevant because the difference in injury rates between training and match play is different, meaning that there could be a sort of skill that can be practiced when it comes to playing safe on turf. The way in which players play on turf dictates its injury rate, not just whether it is turf or not.

This study was used as it looked into a sport other than soccer, one which the hardness and additional friction due to turf has a different impact. It follows five years of the men's varsity football team at Canada West University. Rather than only having lower-body injuries, this study tracked injuries across the body, categorizing them as Head, Neck, Upper Extremities, and Lower extremities. It found a different conclusion than the studies analyzing soccer injury prevalence, and due to the broader range of injuries occurring, expanded on their conclusions. Additionally, this study compared both field types as well as weather conditions, taking both dry and wet fields into account.

This study followed two cohorts of pro soccer players through their spring-fall soccer season, the control group playing on a normal grass field and the experimental group on various types of turf. This is important to my research because it gives a perspective on my topic that surprised me. It categorized the injuries observed for further analysis and comparison, into groups like "traumatic" or "overuse", as well as severity, ranking them as slight, minor, moderate, or severe. Additionally, rather than comparing raw number of injuries, the study compares using the injury rate per 1000 exposure hours in order to control for bias. Many more hours were played on turf than grass, leading to overall more injuries, which is the logical conclusion that the study smartly avoided. This allowed for a more meaningful comparison.

 

Steffen, K., et al. “Risk of Injury on Artificial Turf and Natural Grass in Young Female Football Players.” _British Journal of Sports Medicine_, vol. 41, no. Supplement 1, Aug. 2007, pp. i33–37,[ https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsm.2007.036665](https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsm.2007.036665).

This study followed a U17 league comprised of around 2000 players on 109 teams. This study was observational, assigning physical therapists to 7-8 teams each, and using their data to evaluate the injuries. They classified injuries as either acute (traumatic) or overuse, as well as where the injury occurred on the body and the surface it occurred on. I used this study due to the large amount of data gathered, leading to more generalized and accurate results. It encompassed 142,721 exposure hours (hours spent practicing or playing soccer) and had very in-depth analysis.
